      <Subtitle>
        I&apos;m not a good writer - being a multilingual in 3 languages, 1
        dialect, and N programming languages has made me a Jack of all trades,
        but master of none - but that doesn&apos;t mean I won&apos;t try.

      <Subtitle>
        Here you have access to my unorganized thoughts and bad English, but if
        I were a betting man, I&apos;d say that I&apos;m at the exponentially
        increasing part of a sigmoid curve in my writing journey.

          <BlogTitle>My thoughts on NextJS vs React/Express</BlogTitle>
          <BlogContent>
            Express has been the ultimate Javascript framework for backend
            applications. In fact, 80% of developers are unable to name a second
            JS backend framework when asked, establishing the synonymy of
            Express and the backend...

            I was in it for the clout and prestige associated with a complete
            mastery of both hardware and software, a shallow notion prided by
            technologically deficient parents who don&apos;t know more. Now this
            major has been my biggest regret...

            WRIT 340, Emily Artiano, and Synchronous Classes
          </BlogTitle>
          <BlogContent>
            Solid writing skills are undoubtedly a fundamental part of human
            expression, and USC definitely upholds this belief, with WRIT 340
            being the Achilles&apos; Heel of the mega nerds whose only B+ in
            their whole university comes from this class. But how much is too
            much when Emily Artiano...
